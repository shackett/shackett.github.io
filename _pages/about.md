I spend my days using tools from data science to wrangle big biological datasets. Most of my research involves modeling how yeast and cancer metabolism is shaped by genetics and the environment. The rest of my time I spend watching MMA and training BJJ (I have a purple belt under Emily Kwok and Art Keinz at [Princeton BJJ](http://princetonbjj.com/).

Recently, I have been fusing these passions by using exploratory data analysis to better understand MMA and BJJ.
