My research focuses on understanding how genetic and environmental changes alter the complicated systems of metabolism and physiology. I try to model systems using data-driven approaches that break network-level behavior into simpler sub-questions.

I am currently a postdoc with [John Storey](http://www.genomine.org/index.html) where I am creating interactive methods for exploring data.

A summary of my education and research can be found on my [curriculum vitae]({{ site.url }}/figure/misc/shackett_CV.pdf)

### Graduate Research at Princeton 

I recently completed my PhD in the program of Quantitative and Computational Biology (QCB) at Princeton University; my adviser was [Josh Rabinowitz](https://www.princeton.edu/genomics/rabinowitz/research/).

My research primarily focused on:

- Integrating multiple types of high-throughput metabolic data (proteins, metabolites and fluxes) using biochemically motivated non-linear reaction equations. Through model comparison of these reaction equations, I was able to predict allosteric regulation. Subsequent experimental work verified three instances of novel regulation of major enzymes.
- Identifying reoccuring metabolic changes in primary human tumors by statistical analysis of metabolomics data.
- Understanding how protein levels are determined quantitatively through regulation at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional level.
- Developing statistical methods for integrating mass spectrometry-based measurements from multiple peptides into protein-level summaries

### Undergraduate and post-baccalaureate research at Cornell

After graduating from Cornell, I worked as a research specialist in the laboratory of [Andy Clark](https://blogs.cornell.edu/clarklabblog/) for four years. During that time I worked on a quantitative/population genetics project aimed to determine how heterogeneous metabolic phenotypes were inter-related and dependent on expression and genetic variation using *D. melanogaster* as a model.

While this project is still ongoing, several papers have been published:

- Jennifer K. Grenier, J. Roman Arguello, Margarida Cardoso Moreira, Srikanth Gottipati, Jaaved Mohammed, **Sean R. Hackett**, Rachel Boughton, Anthony J. Greenberg, and Andrew G. Clark. Global Diversity Lines - A five-continent reference panel of sequenced Drosophila melanogaster strains. **G3**, 5(4), 2015.

During my undergraduate research with [Teresa Gunn](http://mclaughlinresearch.org/research-scientists/faculty/teresa-gunn/) at Cornell I investigated the genetic basis of cardiac arrhythmias in dogs:
